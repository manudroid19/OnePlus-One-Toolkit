ADVICE_TEXT1=<html>ALWAYS WHEN YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING OVER ADB -in this toolkit or manually- YOU MUST ACCEPT THE SECURITY PROMPT ON YOUR PHONE. <br><br>\nIf not, it will never work...
ADVICE_TEXT2=<html>Additional Tips/Tricks If You Are Having Difficulties <br>\n<br>\n - Reboot your computer after uninstalling devices with USB Deview before\n   continuing on to the other steps<br>\n<br>\n - Are you sure you can't see your device?  Maybe its just configuring as \n   something else?<br>\n<br>\n   - Try unplugging and replugging your device while watching \n     the device manager; this is a great way to figure out if your device is being \n     improperly recognized; then you can fix it by uninstalling it, scanning for new\n     hardware (with the little magnifying glass icon), and then installing the proper\n     drivers using the instructions in this configuration guide.<br>
